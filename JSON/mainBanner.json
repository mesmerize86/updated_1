		"Description"	:"Web development has been a topic of my interest since I was very young. I started learning web designing about a decade ago in the days of Microsoft frontpage. I always loved digging deep into the code when I find somethings that's new to me.<br/>
		 		No matter how much technology advanced, from animated GIFs to DHTML to jQuery/AJAX, web design and development has always been my passion."
